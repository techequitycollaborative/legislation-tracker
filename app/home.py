The main legislative data (i.e., Bills, Legislators, Committees) is updated twice per day: first between 2-3 AM Pacific Time and again between 2-3 PM Pacific Time. Freshness of data pulled from legislative sources such as LegInfo are subject to the update cadence of those sources, which may vary. Please refer to the "Last Updated" date on the Bills page for the best indication of when the original data was last refreshed.

The California legislative websites may contain errors, or may not be updated on a timely basis, so there may be discrepencies from time to time. We do our best to ensure accuracy.
